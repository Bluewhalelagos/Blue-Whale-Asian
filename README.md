|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **React** | UI Library                                                              | **React** (version 18) was chosen as the core library for building the user interface due to its **component-based architecture**. This approach allows for the creation of reusable UI elements, simplifying development and maintenance. Its vast **ecosystem** provides a wealth of third-party libraries and tools. React's strong **community support** means extensive documentation, tutorials, and quick solutions to common problems. Crucially, its **excellent TypeScript support** was a key factor, aligning with the project's goal of type safety and code robustness. React's Virtual DOM also ensures efficient updates and rendering, contributing to a performant user experience, especially for dynamic features like real-time updates and interactive forms. |
| **Vite** | Build Tool & Development Server                                         | **Vite** was selected over traditional bundlers like Webpack primarily for its **developer experience (DX)** enhancements. Its **blazing-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** and quick server start times significantly speed up the development lifecycle. Vite leverages native ES modules during development, avoiding the need for bundling entire application on every change. For production, it uses Rollup for optimized builds, resulting in smaller bundle sizes and better performance. This modern approach to frontend tooling streamlines the development workflow considerably. |
| **TypeScript** | Static Typing Language                                                  | **TypeScript** was integrated to bring **static typing** to JavaScript. This helps in catching errors during development rather than at runtime, leading to more robust and reliable code. For a project of this scale, with user-facing features and an admin panel, type safety improves **code quality and maintainability**. It also enhances developer productivity through better autocompletion, refactoring capabilities, and clearer code contracts between different parts of the application.                                                              |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-First CSS Framework                                             | **Tailwind CSS** was chosen for styling due to its **utility-first approach**. This allows for rapid UI development directly within the HTML (or JSX in this case) by composing utility classes. It offers high **customizability** without writing custom CSS for every component, leading to a consistent design language. Compared to component-based frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS often results in a **smaller final bundle size** because it only includes the CSS utilities actually used in the project, thanks to its JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler. This flexibility was preferred for creating a unique look and feel for the restaurant's brand. |
| **Firebase** | Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)                                             | **Firebase** serves as the comprehensive backend solution. Its **Firestore** database provides real-time data synchronization, essential for features like live updates on restaurant status, daily specials, and reservation availability. **Firebase Authentication** is used to secure the admin panel. **Firebase Hosting** simplifies the deployment process. Choosing Firebase significantly reduced the complexity and development time associated with building and managing a custom backend infrastructure, allowing the focus to remain on frontend development and user experience. |
| **React Router DOM** | Client-Side Routing                                                     | **React Router DOM** is the standard library for implementing routing in React applications. It enables the creation of a **Single Page Application (SPA)** experience, where navigation between different views or "pages" happens without a full page reload. This results in a faster and smoother user experience. It supports **declarative routing** and **nested routes**, which is particularly useful for structuring the admin panel with its distinct sections (Dashboard, Reservations, Careers, Settings).                                                    |
| **Material UI & lucide-react** | Icon Libraries                                                      | A combination of **Material UI Icons** and **lucide-react** was chosen to provide a **comprehensive and visually appealing set of icons**. Material UI offers a wide range of well-designed icons following Material Design principles, while lucide-react provides a clean, modern, and highly customizable SVG icon set. Using established icon libraries ensures consistency and high quality, and they are generally easy to integrate and customize within React components. |
| **Recharts** | Charting Library                                                        | **Recharts** was selected for rendering interactive charts and data visualizations within the admin dashboard. It's a **composable charting library built on React components**, making it easy to integrate with the existing codebase. It offers a good balance of simplicity for common chart types and customization options for more specific needs, helping to present data like reservation trends or user activity in an understandable format.                                                                                               |
| **Framer Motion** | Animation Library                                                       | **Framer Motion** was chosen to add **smooth animations and transitions**, enhancing the overall user experience. It provides a declarative and powerful API for creating complex animations with relative ease in a React environment. Animations can make the interface feel more dynamic and responsive, guiding user attention and providing visual feedback for interactions, such as page transitions or modal pop-ups.                                                                                                                               |
| **React Slick & Slick Carousel** | Carousel/Slider Components                                        | **React Slick** (which uses Slick Carousel internally) was chosen for implementing **responsive carousels and sliders**. These are used to showcase images in the gallery, daily specials, or other promotional content. React Slick is a popular choice due to its feature-richness (e.g., autoplay, responsive breakpoints, lazy loading) and relative ease of implementation for creating interactive and engaging visual displays.                                                                                                                |
| **React Datepicker** | Date Input Component                                                    | **React Datepicker** provides a **user-friendly and accessible date selection component** for forms, particularly the reservation booking form. It offers a more intuitive way for users to select dates compared to native browser date inputs, with options for customization, localization, and disabling specific dates (e.g., past dates or fully booked dates if integrated with availability logic).                                                                                                                                             |
| **React PDF Viewer** | PDF Display                                                             | **React PDF Viewer** was chosen to allow the restaurant's menu (likely in PDF format) to be **displayed directly within the web application**. This provides a seamless experience for users who want to view the menu without needing to download the file or open it in a separate application. It offers features like zooming and page navigation, enhancing accessibility to important restaurant information.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Resend** | Transactional Email Service                                             | **Resend** was selected for **sending transactional emails reliably**. This is crucial for features like sending automated email confirmations to users after they make a reservation. Resend provides a modern API and focuses on deliverability, ensuring that important communications reach the users. It simplifies the complexities of email infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on the email content and triggers.                                                                                                                            |
| **Google Translate API** | Dynamic Translation Service                                             | The **Google Translate API** was chosen to support **dynamic multi-language translations** for UI text, specifically between English and Portuguese. While static JSON files might be used for some translations, an API allows for broader coverage or for translating user-generated content if needed in the future. It provides a robust and extensive translation engine, ensuring higher accuracy for a wider range of phrases and contexts, crucial for a good user experience for international visitors or different language speakers. |
| **dotenv** | Environment Variable Management                                         | **dotenv** is a utility package used to **load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`**. This is essential for managing sensitive information like API keys (for Firebase, Google Translate, Resend), database credentials, and other configuration settings securely. It keeps such confidential data out of the version-controlled codebase, which is a critical security best practice.                                                                                                                                           |
| **ESLint** | Code Linting                                                            | **ESLint** is a pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript and TypeScript. It helps in maintaining **code quality and consistency** across the project by enforcing coding standards and detecting potential errors or bad practices early in the development process. This is particularly important in a team environment or for long-term project maintainability.                                                                                                                              |

## Folder Structure & Modules

The project is structured to maintain a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to navigate, develop, and maintain.

```
src/
├── admin/                # Contains all components and pages specific to the Admin Panel
│   ├── components/       # Shared UI components for the admin panel (e.g., AdminLayout, Sidebar, AdminNavbar)
│   └── pages/            # Specific views/pages for the admin panel (e.g., DashboardPage, LoginPage, ReservationsManagementPage, CareersPage, SettingsPage)
├── components/           # Reusable UI components shared across the main user-facing application (e.g., Navbar, HeroSection, ImageGallery, MenuSectionDisplay, Footer)
├── firebase/             # Firebase specific configurations and service initializations
│   └── config.ts         # Firebase project configuration (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.) and initialization logic for Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Storage).
├── pages/                # For Next.js or similar frameworks, this often holds API routes or page components. In this Vite/React setup, if used for API-like functions (as hinted for email sending), these might be serverless functions or client-side "pages" that orchestrate specific views.
│                         # Given the context, this might house serverless function handlers if deploying to a platform that supports them alongside Firebase, or it might define top-level page components for React Router.
│                         # If 'pages/' is strictly for client-side page components, API logic might be better placed in 'services/' or a dedicated 'api/' folder at the root or within 'src/'.
│                         # The note "API routes for sending emails are in src/pages/api/" suggests a Next.js-like structure for backend functions, potentially deployed as serverless functions.
├── services/             # Contains modules that encapsulate business logic or external service interactions (e.g., email sending service, data fetching/mutation services for Firebase beyond basic config).
│   └── emailService.ts   # Example: Module for interacting with the Resend API.
├── utils/                # Utility functions and helpers that are used across various parts of the application.
│   └── translationHelpers.ts # Example: Functions to assist with i18n, perhaps interfacing with Google Translate API or managing local translation strings.
│   └── formatters.ts     # Example: Functions for formatting dates, currency, etc.
├── App.tsx               # The main application component. This typically includes the primary layout, router setup, and global context providers.
├── main.tsx              # The entry point of the React application. This file is responsible for rendering the root `App` component into the DOM and setting up React Router.
├── index.css             # Global styles, including Tailwind CSS base styles, layer directives (@tailwind base, @tailwind components, @tailwind utilities), and any custom global CSS.
└── vite-env.d.ts         # TypeScript declaration file for Vite-specific environment variables, providing type safety for `import.meta.env`.

## Additional Notes

  - Environment variables are crucial for the application's configuration and security. They should be defined in a `.env` file at the project root. This file should be included in `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive information. Example variables would include `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `VITE_RESEND_API_KEY`, `VITE_GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY`.
  - The Firebase configuration, including API keys and project IDs, is centralized in `src/firebase/config.ts`. This file initializes the Firebase app and exports the necessary Firebase services (like `db`, `auth`).
  - The mention of API routes in `src/pages/api/` (e.g., for sending emails) suggests a setup that might involve serverless functions, possibly deployed through a platform like Vercel or Netlify if not using Firebase Functions directly for these. If using Firebase Functions, these would typically reside in a separate `functions` directory at the project root. This part of the architecture is key for backend operations that shouldn't run on the client-side.
  - The admin panel, accessible via specific routes, is protected. This typically involves checking for an authenticated Firebase user session before rendering admin components and redirecting unauthenticated users to a login page.
